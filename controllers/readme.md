âœ… Whatâ€™s Good in This Code?
âœ… Feature	                                               -->           ðŸ’¡ Why It's Good
Password hashing with salt rounds (12)	                    -->          Secure and modern practice
bcrypt.compare() for login	Correct way                     -->          to check passwords
Validation (username/password checks)	                    -->          Avoids bad input, improves security
Password strength check (regex)	                            -->          Encourages strong passwords ðŸ”’
No plain password stored or sent	                        -->          Follows real-world security rules
Reusable helper functions (hashPassword, verifyPassword)    -->          DRY code (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Error handling + status codes	                            -->          Realistic and user-friendly
Prepared for JWT/session later	                            -->          Easy to extend with auth tokens
